In supervised machine learning, we start with a structured dataset where each observation is a row and each variable is a column. The goal is to use a number of features (previously you might have called these \"covariates,\" \"independent variables,\" or \"regressors\") to train a model that predicts a target (previously you might have called these \"outcome variable\" or \"dependent variable\"). In this case, we will use information like age, education, and marital status to predict each person's income-bracket.\n",

The problem is that that number of observations required grows much faster than the number of features. So, there's a fundamental trade off between increasing the number features to improve model performance, but reducing it to avoid the instability and overfitting that will occur with too few observations. This another important tradeoff at the heart of supervised machine learning. \n",

    "Another key aspect of machine learning is splitting our data. In your previous statistics classes, you likely fit regression models on an entire dataset. The problem with fitting a model this way is that models will tend to perform better on the data that they are trained on, but then perform less well on out of sample data. In some ways, the framework we will use in machine learning has grown out of this critque, but also is a result of a stronger focus on prediction. \n",

Trading off between these two sources of error is an essential part of machine learning. \n",

    "As you can see, choosing the optimal train/validation/test split can be difficult. It is also prone to high variance problems as the machine learning algorithm's performance will be very dependent on the composition of the randomly sampled test split. This problem is exacerbated in small datasets especially. One way to address this problem is with [cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#:~:text=Cross%2Dvalidation%2C%20sometimes%20called%20rotation,to%20an%20independent%20data%20set).\n",

    "The general procedure is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly split the data into k-folds\n",
    "2. Build the model on k-1 folds, then test on the last fold\n",
    "3. Record prediction error\n",
    "4. Cycle until each fold has served as the test set\n",
    "5. The average of the errors is the cv-error\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation has the advantage of allowing every data point to be in the test set once. By averaging the errors, the model is less sensitive to variation in the random samples, and is less prone to overfitting. Let's try with our logistic regression again, using the [cross_val_predict](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_predict.html) method."
