As we saw in last week's lab, an important advantage of randomized experiments are that they allow researchers to ensure independence between the exposure variable and other covariates, or rather that treatment and control groups have similar covariate distributions and differ only randomly. 

The same cannot be said of observational studies, *no matter how large the sample size*. Thus, researchers often use a variety of matching methods to try to replicate this matching of covariate distributions between exposure groups.

In this lab we will consider some of these matching methods. Note that these methods are all implemented in the analysis stage (i.e. after the study has already been completed), and are distinct from (though may be similar to) methods of conducting studies which are matched from the outset.

Furthermore, matching should **not** be seen as an alternative to modeling adjustments such as regression, but instead are often used together.

# Simulation 

We will again use the simulated example from last week assessing the effectiveness of AspiTyleCedrin at treating migraines. As a reminder, this dataset contained the following variables:

* `A`: Treatment variable indicating whether individual $i$: 
  - **DID** take AspiTyleCedrin ($A_i = 1$) 
  - **DID NOT** take AspiTyleCedrin ($A_i = 0$)
* `Y_obs`: Outcome variable indicating whether individual $i$:
  -  **DID** experienced a migraine ($Y_{i_{obs}} = 1$) 
  - **DID NOT** experience a migraine ($Y_{i_{obs}} = 0$)
* `W1`: Variable representing sex assigned at birth: 
  - $W1 = 0$ indicating AMAB (assigned male at birth)
  - $W1 = 1$ indicating AFAB (assigned female at birth)
  - $W1 = 2$ indicating an X on the birth certificate, intersex individual, or left blank
* `W2`: Variable representing simplified racial category: 
  - $W2 = 0$ indicating White 
  - $W2 = 1$ indicating Black or African American
  - $W2 = 2$ indicating Non-White Hispanic or Latinx
  - $W2 = 3$ indicating American Indian or Alaska Native
  - $W2 = 4$ indicating Asian
  - $W2 = 5$ indicating Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander

Say that there is concern among providers that AspiTyleCedrin may be less effective among individuals with a higher Body Mass Index (BMI). To simulate this, we will modify the code we used to create the original AspiTyleCedrin dataset to also include the variable `W3` representing an individual's BMI. (We'll also modify the treatment and observed outcomes to be confounded by this variable.)

```{r}

# set seed
# ----------
set.seed(42) # set so that random process of generating data is reproducible 

# set the number of individuals for simulated dataset
# ----------
n = 1e4 # Number of individuals (smaller than last time)

# NOTE: Again, don't worry too much about how we're creating this dataset, 
# this is just an example.

# W3 scaled to have mu=24 and sigma=4 a la
# https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4789291/
# where k = mu^2/sigma^2 and theta = sigma^2/mu

# Also make treatment less likely so that there are more controls,
# and add ID column
df <- data.frame(ID = seq.int(n),
                 W1 = sample(0:2, size = n, replace = TRUE, 
                             prob = c(0.49,0.50,0.01)),
                 W2 = sample(0:5, size = n, replace = TRUE, 
                             prob = c(0.60,0.13,0.19,0.06, 0.015, 0.005)),
                 W3 = rgamma(n, 
                    shape = 36,
                    scale = (2/3)))
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(W3 = W3 + 8*(W1 == 1)+ 12*(W2==2) + 
           8*(W2==3) + 4*(W2==4) + (-4)*(W2 == 5),
         A = as.numeric(rbernoulli(n, 
                                   p = (0.16 + 0.07*(W1 > 0) + 0.21*(W2 == 0) - 
                                          0.1*(W3 > 25) ))),
         Y_0 = as.numeric(rbernoulli(n, 
                                     p = (0.87 + 0.035*(W1 > 0) + 0.05*(W2 > 0)) + 
                                       abs((W3 - 22)/100))),
         Y_1 = as.numeric(rbernoulli(n, 
                                     p = (0.34 + 0.035*(W1 > 0) + 0.3*(W2 > 0)) + 
                                       abs((W3 - 22)/100) + 0.2*(W3 > 30))),
         ITE = Y_1 - Y_0,
         Y_obs = as.numeric((A & Y_1) | (!A & Y_0))) 

ATE_true <- mean(df$ITE)
df_a1 <- df %>% filter(A == 1)
ATT_true <- mean(df_a1$ITE)

df <- df %>% select(-Y_0, -Y_1, -ITE)
df_a1 <- df_a1 %>% select(-Y_0, -Y_1, -ITE)
df_a0 <- df %>% filter(A == 0)
                 
head(df)
summary(df)
```

Let's take a look at the covariate distributions, comparing those that did and did not take AspiTyleCedrin:

## Sex Assigned at Birth (SAAB)

For this chunk, there is extra `ggplot` code that illustrates how you might customize a figure for publication. There is a lot more you can do, so be sure to delve into the `ggplot` [documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) to see all that is possible.

```{r}

#
# treatment status by sex 
# --------------------------------------------------
df %>% 
  
  # processing 
  # ----------
  mutate(sex = case_when(W1 == 0 ~ "Male",        # assigned male at birth 
                         W1 == 1 ~ "Female",      # assigned female at birth 
                         W1 == 2 ~ "X/intersex"), # an X on the birth certificate,representing an intersex individual or left blank
         sex = fct_relevel(sex, "Male", "Female", "X/intersex"),
         treatment = case_when(A == 0 ~ "Control", 
                               A == 1 ~ "Treatment")
         ) %>% 

  # plot 
  # ----------
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, fill = treatment)) + 
    # create a bar plot using geom_bar()
    geom_bar() +
    geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), # calculate count and pass to label parameter using ".."
              vjust = -0.5) +                         # vjust to add space between bar and text
    
    # facet grid controls number of panels - prefer this to facet_wrap
    facet_grid(
               #rows= vars(treatment), # facet variable in the rows
               cols = vars(treatment)  # facets variable in the column
               ) + 
   # theme 
   theme_bw() +                        # set base black and white theme
   theme(legend.position = "bottom") + # theme functions manipulate different elements of the plots appearance

  
   # scales 
   scale_fill_manual(values=c("#800000","#027148")) +               # assign colors using hex code

                      labels = scales::label_number(scale = 1,      # scale the variable 
                                                    accuracy = 1,   # decimal points
                                                    big.mark = ",", # add "," or "."
                                                    prefix = "",    # add "$" 
                                                    suffix = ""),   # add suffix, e.g., "%" or "k"
                      limits = c(0, 4000)) +                        # set floor and ceiling
    # labels
    labs(x = "Sex Assigned at Birth ",  # x-axis label
     	   y = "Count",                   # y-axis label
     	   fill = "Treatment status",     # legend label
         caption = "Note: ",            # add a caption
         title = "Distribution of Sex Assigned at Birth Treatment Status") # title 


# chi-squared to test difference 
# ----------
chisq.test(table(df$A, df$W1))
```

The bar plot above clearly shows a difference in the distribution of SAAB among the two groups, and this is confirmed by the very small p-value from the $\chi^2$ test.

Go ahead and reproduce a similar table by treatment status for race using the code above.

```{r}

#
# treatment status by race
# --------------------------------------------------
# YOUR CODE HERE


# chi-squared to test difference  
# ----------
chisq.test(table(df$A, df$W2))
```

The bar plot above again shows a difference in the distribution of simplified racial category among the two groups, and this is again confirmed by the very small p-value from the $\chi^2$ test.You can find more documentation for the plotting parameters [here](https://r-charts.com/distribution/histogram-density-ggplot2/).

Finally, we can use `geom_hist` to view the distribution of BMI by treatment status, which is a continuious variable.

```{r}
#
# treatment status by BMI
# --------------------------------------------------
df %>% 
  
  # processing 
  # ----------
  mutate(...)
         ) %>% 
  # plot 
  # ----------
  ggplot(aes(x = W3, fill = treatment)) + 
  geom_...(binwidth = 1, aes(y = ..density..)) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(treatment)) +  # facets variable in the column
  
  # theme 
   theme_bw() +                        # set base black and white theme
   theme(legend.position = "bottom") + # theme functions manipulate different elements of the plots appearance
  
  labs(title = "Distribution of BMI among Treated and Untreated", 
       x = "BMI",
       fill = "")

# t-test 
# ---------
t.test(W3 ~ A, data = df)
```

While it may be difficult to determine from the histogram above how the distribution of BMI differs among the two groups, the very small p-value from the t-test shows evidence of a clear difference.

Thus we can see the need to improve the matching of these covariate distributions.

# Matching Considerations

There are a number of factors to consider when choosing a matching method, including the following:

* Distance Metric
* Greediness
* Control:Treatment Ratio
* Caliper Width 
* Replacement
* Estimand

## Distance Metric

The goal of matching is to match together each treatment unit (in our case, each individual who took AspiTyleCedrin, `A == 1`) to one or more "control" unit (in our case, individuals who did not take AspiTyleCedrin, `A == 0`) based on baseline covariates (in our case, `W1, W2, W3`). **Conceptually, this means we are trying to find the control unit(s) that most closely resemble the counterfactual for each treatment unit.**

### Exact Matching

Ideally, we would like to find the control unit(s) which have all identical covariate values. This is called "exact matching". 

For our dataset, this would mean each individual who took AspiTyleCedrin (`A == 1`) would be matched with individual(s) who did not take AspiTyleCedrin (`A == 0`) with the *exact* same SAAB (`W1`), racial category (`W2`), and BMI (`W3`). 

In other words, the exact distance between two points $X_i,X_j$, where $X_i = \{W1_i, W2_i, W3_i\}$ and $X_j = \{W1_j, W2_j, W3_j\}$ is defined as:

\begin{align*}
    \text{Distance}(X_i, X_j) = 
\begin{cases}
    0,       & \text{if } X_i = X_j\\
    \infty,  & \text{if } X_i \neq X_j
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 1:}** The data frame `df_a0` contains all the individuals that did not take AspiTyleCedrin, and the data frame `df_a1` contains all those who did. In the `R` code chunk below, use the first ten rows of `df_a0` and the first five rows of `df_a1` to find the exact distance of the first ten individuals who did not take AspiTyleCedrin from *each* of the first five individuals who did. (Hint: How many comparisons should you be making?)

```{r}
#
# calculate exact matches by hand
# --------------------------------------------------

# create dataframe
# ---------
df_a0_small <- df_a0[1:10,] 
df_a1_small <- df_a1[1:5,]  
cols <- c("W1", "W2", "W3")

# create function to only keep where observations are equal 
# # ---------
dist.exact <- function(x,y) {
  ifelse(all(x == y), 0, NA) # NA means no match
}

# funciton to calculate distances
# ---------
calculate.dist <- function(x, y, dist.method, xnames = df_a1_small$ID, ynames = df_a0_small$ID) {
  dists <- apply(y, 1, function(j) {apply(x, 1, function(i) {dist.method(i,j)})})
  rownames(dists) <- xnames
  colnames(dists) <- ynames
  return(dists)
}

# apply to data and save as new object
# ---------
dists_ex <- calculate.dist(df_a1_small[, cols], # x 
                           df_a0_small[, cols], # y
                           dist.exact)          # distance metric
dists_ex

```


While exact matching is ideal, it is not always possible, such as in the case of continuous variables, such as our BMI variable, `W3`. 

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 2:}** Explain why matching on a continuous variable would likely be impossible.

The probability of any exact value of a continuous variable is by definition zero, so even taking rounding into account, the probability of finding exact matches on a continuous variable is very low.

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 3:}** Modify your code above to only check the distance for `W1` and `W2` values.

```{r}
# check again but omit W3 (BMI)
# ---------
dists_ex_lim <- calculate.dist(df_a1_small[, cols[1:2]], df_a0_small[, cols[1:2]], dist.exact)
dists_ex_lim
```

Since exact matching is not always possible, there are a variety of alternative distance metrics which may be used to determine how similar a potential match is. A few of these methods are discussed below.

### Mahalanobis Distance Matching

The Mahalanobis distance in general is a "multi-dimensional generalization of the idea of measuring how many standard deviations away [some point] P is from the mean of [some distribution] D." However, in the context of matching, the Mahalanobis distance measures this distance between the two points $X_i,X_j$ rather than that between one point and a distribution. 

Mathematically, this version of the Mahalanobis distance is defined as follows:

$$\text{Distance}(X_i, X_j) = \sqrt{(X_i - X_j)^T S^{-1} (X_i - X_j)} $$
where $S^{-1}$ is the covariance matrix of $X_i$ and $X_j$. 

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 4:}** Using the `cov()` function to find the covariance matrix of $\{W1, W2, W3\}$ from the *whole dataset*, modify your code from **Question 1** to instead find the Mahalanobis distance of the first ten individuals who did not take AspiTyleCedrin from *each* of the first five individuals who did. (Hint: The `t()` function will transpose a vector or matrix, and matrix multiplication uses the `%*%` character, not `*`)

```{r}
#
# calculate Mahalanobis distance metric
# --------------------------------------------------

# calculate covariance matrix
# ---------
cov_df <- cov(df[,cols])

# create a function to calculate mahalanobis distance
# ---------
dist_mahalanobis <- function(x,y) {
  diff <- (x - y)                       # return the difference of x-matrix from y-matrix
  sqrt( t(diff) %*% cov_df %*% (diff) ) # transpose difference and multiply by the covariance and the difference 
}

# apply function to calculate Mahalanobis distance 
# ---------
dists_ma <- calculate.dist(df_a1_small[, cols], # x
                           df_a0_small[, cols], # y
                           dist_mahalanobis)    # distance
# return
dists_ma
```

### Propensity Score Matching

The propensity score of an individual is a measure of the probabilty of that individual receiving the treatment based upon the baseline covariates. That is, given a set of covariate values ($\{W1_i, W2_i, W3_i\}$ in our case), the propensity score represents the estimated probability of treatment ($A_i = 1$). The propensity score is often estimated using a logit model and is therefore defined as follows:

$\pi_i = P(A_i = 1 | X_i) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-X_i \beta}}$

We can estimate these propensity scores using logistic regression, by regressing the treatment $A$ on the baseline covariates $X$, like so:

```{r}
#
# fit a logit model
# --------------------------------------------------
model_ps <-                 # save logit model as an object
  glm(A ~ W1 + W2 + W3,     # regress A (treatment) on covariates (W1, W2, W3) 
      family = binomial(),  # specifying binomial calls a logit model
      data = df)            # specify data for regression

# print summary
summary(model_ps)
```

We can then use this model and the `predict()` function to add all of the estimated propensity scores for each data point in `df`:

```{r}
# predict
# ---------
df <-                                    # save over df dataframe object
  df %>%                                 # pass data 
  mutate(prop_score = predict(model_ps)) # create a new variable that predicts propensity score based on logit model

# update the subsetted datasets - WOULD NOT DO THIS IN YOUR WORK
# ---------
df_a0 <- df %>% filter(A == 0) # save anything under control as a dataframe
df_a1 <- df %>% filter(A == 1) # save anything under treatment as a dataframe
df_a0_small <- df_a0[1:10,]    # further subsetting
df_a1_small <- df_a1[1:5,]     # further subsetting 

```

Propensity score *matching* uses the absolute difference between two propensity scores as its distance metric, or rather:

$$\text{Distance}(X_i, X_j) = |\pi_i - \pi_j| $$
**\textcolor{blue}{Question 5:}** Again modify your previous code to find the propensity score distance of the first ten individuals who did not take AspiTyleCedrin from *each* of the first five individuals who did.

```{r}
# calculate distances based on propensity scores
# ---------
dist.prop.score <- function(x,y) {
  abs(x-y)  # distance based on absolute value
}

# apply function
# ---------
dists_ps <- calculate.dist(as.matrix(df_a1_small[, "prop_score"]), # x
                           as.matrix(df_a0_small[, "prop_score"]), # y
                           dist.prop.score)                        # method
# view
dists_ps
```

#### Double Robustness

A key advantage of propensity score matching is that, when used in conjunction with outcome regression, provides a "doubly robust" estimator. That is,

> "When used individually to estimate a causal effect, both outcome regression and propensity score methods are unbiased only if the statistical model is correctly specified. The doubly robust estimator combines these 2 approaches such that only 1 of the 2 models need be correctly specified to obtain an unbiased effect estimator."

"Correctly specified" means that a model accurately represents the relationship between the variables. E.g. a linear model between $x$ and $y$ is correctly specified if and only if $x$ and $y$ truly do have a linear relationship to each other.

This means that only one of the two models (the model of treatment to covariates or the model of outcome to treatment and covariates) needs to accurately represent the relationships among the respective variables in order for the estimate to be unbiased.

## Greediness

Once deciding upon a distance metric, we must also choose a matching algorithm. That is, how shall the computed distances be used to determine a match? The various matching algorithms fall into two general categories: "greedy" and optimal.

### "Greedy" Matching

Greedy algorithms in general are used to reduce larger problems to smaller ones by taking the best option at the time and repeating, while never returning to earlier choices to make changes. In the context of matching, this means that a greedy matching algorithm chooses the best single match first and removes that chosen match. It then repeats this process by choosing the best single match still remaining and removing that match, and so on.

There are a number of different ways to decide which match to deem "best", including but not limited to:

* Choose the treatment participant with the highest propensity score first, and match it to the "control" participant with the closest propensity score (shortest propensity score distance).
* Same as above but start with lowest rather than highest propensity score.
* The best overall match (minimum of all match distances) in the entire dataset.
* Random selection.

Most greedy matching algorithms in common use (including those listed above) are "nearest neighbor" algorithms, which choose a treatment individual first and match to a control individual rather than the reverse.

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 6:}** Using the propensity score distances you made in Question 5, find the greedy matching of this subset using highest to lowest propensity score. Report the IDs of both elements of each matched pair. (Hint: You may find the `which.min()` and `which.max()` functions helpful)

```{r}

#
# use greedy matching - subset on highest to lowest propensity
# --------------------------------------------------

# create new datasets
# ---------
treat <- c()
control <- c()
df_a1_small_copy <- as.data.frame(df_a1_small)
dists_ps_copy <- as.data.frame(dists_ps)

# loop through to grab matches based on propensity scores
# ---------
for(i in 1:nrow(df_a1_small)) {
  ...
}

# print
# ---------
treat
control
```

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 7:}** Same as Question 6, but now find the greedy matching of this subset using lowest to highest propensity score.

```{r}

#
# use greedy matching - subset on lowest to highest propensity
# --------------------------------------------------


# create new datasets
# ---------
treat <- c()
control <- c()
df_a1_small_copy <- as.data.frame(df_a1_small)
dists_ps_copy <- as.data.frame(dists_ps)

# loop through to grab matches based on propensity scores
# ---------
for(i in 1:nrow(df_a1_small)) {
  ...
}

# print
# ---------
treat
control
```


**\textcolor{blue}{Question 8:}** Same as in the previous two problems, but now find the greedy matching of this subset using best overall match.

```{r}

#
# use greedy matching - subset using best overall
# --------------------------------------------------

# create new datasets
# ---------
treat <- c()
control <- c()
dists_ps_copy <- as.data.frame(dists_ps)

# loop through to grab matches based on propensity scores
# ---------
for(i in 1:nrow(df_a1_small)) {
  ...
}

# print
# ---------
treat
control
```

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 9:}** Were there any differences in the matchings you found in the previous three problems?

> Your answer here.

### Optimal Matching

Optimal matching, as the name implies, seeks to find an optimal matching scheme in which the overall match difference is minimized. For example, if we were to add the distances of all match pairs chosen, an optimal matching would seek the set of match pairs which produces the smallest sum. A disadvantage of optimal matching is that it can be computationally intensive without providing sufficient improvements over greedy matching.

## Control:Treatment Ratio

You may have noticed that in the previous examples we only selected one "control" individual for each treatment individual, often called $1:1$ matching. However, in some cases we may prefer to match more than one control to each treatment, often called $k:1$ matching, where $k$ is the number of control individuals desired per treatment individual. (Note: while we are not considering them here, there are matching algorithms which discard treatment individuals rather than control individuals)

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 10:}** Modify your code from Question 6 to perform a 2:1 matching rather than 1:1. That is, find the two best "control" matches for each treatment individual, using highest to lowest propensity score. 

```{r}
#
# manual matching - using 2:1 ratio
# --------------------------------------------------
# 
# create new datasets
# ---------
treat <- c()
control_1 <- c()
control_2 <- c()
df_a1_small_copy <- as.data.frame(df_a1_small)
dists_ps_copy <- as.data.frame(dists_ps)

# loop through to grab matches based on propensity scores
# ---------
for(i in 1:nrow(df_a1_small)) {
  ...
  
}

# print
# ---------
treat
control_1
control_2
```

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 11:}** Did any of the matches you made in Question 6 change in Question 10?

> Your answer here.

It is also possible to have a variable number of control individuals per treatment individual in "full" matching. Full matching assures that every individual in the dataset is paired. Full matching can only by achieved using an optimal matching algorithm.

## Caliper Width

As seen in $1:1$ and $k:1$ matching, some data may be pruned in favor of other priorities. We may also choose to prune data for which a sufficiently close match can be found. For this method we choose a threshold, or "caliper", and only consider matches whose distance is within this caliper width, discarding any individuals left unmatched.

## Replacement

Another consideration when deciding upon a matching algorithm is whether matches are made with or without replacement. That is, can the same control individual be matched to more than one treatment individual. You may notice that so far we have only considered matching without replacement.

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 12:}** Write code to perform the same greedy matching as in Question 6 but **with** replacement. (Hint: This code will likely be much simpler!)

```{r}
# Your code here
```

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 13:}** Compare these matches to those you found in Question 6.

## Estimand

Depending on the matching algorithm used, you may be limited in whether it is possible to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) or the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) only. For example, 1:1 nearest neighbor matching almost always estimates the ATT and cannot estimate the ATE.

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 14:}** Briefly explain why 1:1 nearest neighbor matching may not be able to estimate the ATE.

# Matching Algorithm Examples

As we've seen using our small subset of the data, implementing matching algorithms from scratch can be rather complex. Thankfully, we can use the `MatchIt` package which can implement many different matching algorithm variations for us.

The main `matchit()` function of this package includes the following arguments:

* `formula` : A formula object specifying the the treatment variable `A` and the covariates to be matched upon `X`, X2,...` in the following format: `A ~ X1 + X2 + ...`.
* `data` : The data frame.
* `method`: Matching method to be used. Options include (but are not limited to): "nearest" (i.e. Nearest Neighbor), "optimal", "full", "exact".
* `distance`: Distance metric to be used. Options include (but are not limited to): "glm" (e.g.Propensity score matching using a generalized linear model such as regression), "mahalanobis", a numeric vector containing already calculated distances.
* `link`: The link function used with the option chosen in `distance`. (e.g. "logit" if using logistic regression for propensity score matching)
* `estimand`: The value to be estimated.  Options include (but are not limited to): "ATE", "ATT". Note that "ATE" is not available for all matching methods.
* `discard`: Which type of units may be discardes. Options are: "control" (i.e. most of the examples we have considered so far), "treatment", "none", "both".
* `replace`: Whether matching should be done with (`TRUE`) or without (`FALSE`) replacement.
* `caliper`: The caliper widths to use for each variable (if any) while matching.
* `ratio`: How many control units should be matched to each treatment unit.

## Exact Matching Example

### ATE

For example, for an exact matching on our dataset ignoring BMI we would do the following to estimate ATE:

```{r}

#
# ATE using matchit 
# --------------------------------------------------
match_exact_ate <- matchit(formula = ...     # formula (leave out W3 bc it is continuous)
                           data = ...,       # specify data 
                           method = "...",   # specify method you want to use
                           estimand = "...") # specify estimand you want

# view
summary(match_exact_ate)

```

We can see from the summary how much the balance has improved after matching, but remember that this is only the balance on `W1` and `W2`.

To use this matching to estimate the ATE we first get the matched data using the `match.data()` function. We can then use logistic regression to estmate the ATE.

```{r}

#
# estimate the ATE using linear regression
# ---------

# construct a matched dataset from the matchit object
match_exact_ate_data <- match.data(match_exact_ate)

# specify a linear model 
lm_exact_ate <- lm(Y_obs ~ A + W1 + W2 + W3,    # specify the linear model 
                   data = match_exact_ate_data, # specify the data  
                   weights = weights)           # specify the weights

# view summary of results 
lm_exact_ate_summ <- summary(lm_exact_ate)
lm_exact_ate_summ

```

The ATE estimate is the coefficient estimate on the treatment variable `A`:

```{r}

#
# pull out ATE
# ---------
ATE_exact <- lm_exact_ate_summ$coefficients["A", "Estimate"]
ATE_exact

```

### ATT

We could also have estimated the ATT using this method. Modify the workflow from above to replicate estimate the ATT. 

```{r}
# Your code here
```


## $k$ Nearest Neighbor Matching Example

### ATT

Now let's perform a 2:1 nearest neighbor matching using (logistic regression) propensity scores on all three covariates. Remember that we can only estimate ATT in this case.

```{r}
# Your code here
```

## Full Optimal Mahalanobis Matching Example

Now let's perform a full optimal matching on all three covariates using Mahalanobis distances. (We'll need to do this on a smaller subset of the data)

```{r}

# set seed 
set.seed(1000)

# create a smaller dataframe so this runs more quickly 
df_small <- 
  df %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 1000) # SRS of 1000

```

### ATE

```{r}
# Your code here
```

### ATT
```{r}
# Your code here
```

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 15:}** Perform a matching algorithm of your own choosing. Report the estimated ATE or ATT where available. (Note: If your chosen algorithm takes too long to run on `df` you may instead use `df_small`)

```{r}
# Your code here
```

**\textcolor{blue}{Question 16:}** Compare the estimates of ATE and ATT found above with the true values (saved as `ATE_true` and `ATT_true`). Which method was most accurate? Considering the pros and cons of different methods we have discussed, which method do you prefer?

```{r}

#
# compare ATE and ATT across matching algorithims
# ---------
# compare ATE
ATE_true
c(ATE_exact, ATE_full)

# compare ATT
ATT_true
c(ATT_exact, ATT_ps, ATT_full)

```
