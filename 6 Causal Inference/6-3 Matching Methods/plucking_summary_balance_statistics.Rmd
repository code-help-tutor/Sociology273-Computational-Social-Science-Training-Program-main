# Run Matching analysis for Exact matching

Run the match analysis to and store the details in an object called `match_exact_ate`.

```{r}

#
# ATE using matchit for exact
# --------------------------------------------------
match_exact_ate <- matchit(formula = A ~ W1 + W2, # formula (leaving out W3 bc it is continuous)
                           data = df,             # data 
                           method = "exact",      # specify method to use
                           estimand = "ATE")      # specify estimand you want

# view
summary(match_exact_ate)


```

There are a number of ways to view balance statistics. Check out the online documentation [here](https://kosukeimai.github.io/MatchIt/articles/assessing-balance.html#assessing-balance-with-matchit). However, if you want to pull out summary statistics so you can manually manipulate them to create you own table or ggplot, for example, you need the `pluck()` function to pull specific information for the lists (which is how they are stored). 

You can use the code `summary(match_exact_ate) %>% View()` to view the stored information which is saved as lists. 

```{r}
summary(match_exact_ate) %>% glimpse() #use View here instead
```

You can then `pluck()` elements of the lists as you see fit. Here's an example of how to "pluck"  the `sum.all` column, which you can then manipulate into a datframe and use in a ggplot or a table.  

```{r}



# pluck the "Summary of Balance" column
# note you will need to manually create a column to identify W1 and W2 rows 
summary_df <- 
  summary(match_exact_ate) %>% 
  pluck("sum.all") %>%  # Summary of Balance for All Data
  as_tibble() %>% 
  glimpse() 

```

Similarly, you can view summary statistics with another package called `cobalt`. 


```{r}

# summarize statistics 
bal.tab(match_exact_ate, un = TRUE, stats = c("m", "v", "ks"))


```

View the list of the information stored in this object. 

```{r}

# View list of the stored information 
bal.tab(match_exact_ate, un = TRUE, stats = c("m", "v", "ks")) %>% 
  glimpse() # use "View" here instead

```


Pluck the "balance" and create a data frame. 

```{r}

# pluck the "Balance" column
balance_statistics <- 
  bal.tab(match_exact_ate, un = FALSE, stats = c("m", "v", "ks")) %>% 
  pluck("Balance") %>% 
  glimpse()

```
